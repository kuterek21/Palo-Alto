During Bootup with an Unknown Admin User Password


If you do not know the admin account password, you must first boot the firewall into maintenance mode. 

As the firewall is booting up, type the operational command maint into the CLI through the serial console port. 
After some time has elapsed, you can choose Reset to Factory Default to reset the firewall to its factory default settings. 
You can set the default admin password or load a previous configuration file if the admin password has been inadvertently changed or an invalid config has been loaded.
